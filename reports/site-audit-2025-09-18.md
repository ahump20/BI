# Blaze Intelligence Web Presence Audit
*Comprehensive assessment conducted on 18 September 2025*

## Executive Summary
- **Overall readiness: 66/100.** The platform delivers an ambitious, content-rich single-page experience, yet significant technical debt in performance, accessibility, and analytics implementation limits its effectiveness as an executive-facing intelligence hub.
- **Immediate priorities:** streamline render-blocking assets, rationalize information hierarchy, and harden analytics/configuration management ahead of additional automation launches.
- **Strategic opportunity:** the new Social Media Intelligence API unlocks cross-channel storytelling, but production success will require a unified data pipeline, governance guardrails, and stakeholder-specific dashboards.

## Scorecard Snapshot
| Pillar | Score | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experience & Content | 70 | Premium storytelling, but overwhelming hero motion and dense copy reduce scannability. |
| Performance & Reliability | 58 | Eleven external scripts load before content paint; no bundling or lazy loading strategy. |
| Accessibility & Compliance | 60 | Strong typography, yet insufficient contrast in gradients and missing ARIA landmarks in critical sections. |
| Growth & Analytics | 62 | GA4 scaffolding exists but lacks production IDs and server-side event routing. |
| Security & Privacy | 78 | Netlify CSP and denial headers in place, although `unsafe-inline` allowances keep risk surface high. |

## Detailed Findings

### Front-End Architecture & Content Operations
- The production landing page (`index.html`) is a monolithic file exceeding 3,000 lines, combining layout, animation logic, and data visualizations; this structure complicates iterative updates, regression testing, and variant launches.【F:index.html†L1-L120】
- Twelve CDN-hosted Three.js modules plus Chart.js are loaded synchronously in the `<head>`, introducing ~600 KB of blocking JavaScript before first paint; a bundler (Vite/ESBuild) with deferred imports would improve responsiveness and offline parity.【F:index.html†L12-L24】
- Multiple alternate homepages (`index-unified.html`, `index_updated.html`, `/site/pages/*`) coexist without routing governance, creating ambiguity for Netlify deploy targets and analytics attribution.【F:index-unified.html†L1-L40】

### Performance & Infrastructure
- Netlify build configuration ships the pre-compiled `dist/` directory without any minification or asset hashing, undermining cache efficiency for repeat visitors.【F:netlify.toml†L1-L14】
- The CSP emitted from `netlify.toml` allows `'unsafe-inline'` script and style directives, neutralizing most XSS protections and conflicting with enterprise security baselines; refactoring inline CSS/JS would enable stricter policies.【F:netlify.toml†L15-L24】
- `robots.txt` references `https://blaze-intelligence.com/sitemap.xml`, but the live property resolves to the Netlify subdomain; sitemap submission and canonical domain alignment should be audited before paid traffic runs.【F:robots.txt†L1-L7】

### Accessibility & Compliance
- Key hero sections rely on background gradients with white text (e.g., `linear-gradient(135deg, #0a0a0a 0%, #1a1a2e 100%)` with `color: #fff`), yet numerous CTA buttons revert to low-contrast amber/orange combos under 4.5:1, failing WCAG AA for body text.【F:index.html†L41-L115】
- The page omits semantic landmarks (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>` elements are simulated with `<div>` containers), and no skip navigation link is provided—impacting keyboard and screen reader usability for data-dense dashboards.【F:index.html†L115-L220】
- Animated loading screens and 3D canvases lack reduced-motion fallbacks, increasing vestibular discomfort risk for sensitive users.【F:index.html†L47-L83】

### Growth, Analytics, and Measurement
- `analytics-config.js` establishes a robust GA4 event taxonomy but retains placeholder IDs (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`) and manual script injection. Without environment-based secrets, staging and production share identical measurement properties, inhibiting attribution fidelity.【F:analytics-config.js†L7-L74】
- Scroll-depth, time-on-page, and outbound-link events fire entirely client-side with console logging; migrating critical conversions (demo requests, NIL calculator completions) to secure server endpoints will improve reliability and consent compliance.【F:analytics-config.js†L74-L144】
- Contact and lead capture forms reference multiple automation scripts (`lead.js`, `client-onboarding.js`) without unified consent storage, risking misaligned messaging cadence during multi-channel campaigns.【F:lead.js†L1-L120】

### Data & API Integrations
- The repository maintains discrete automation stacks (`api`, `api-unified`, `services`, `automation`) with overlapping functionality; consolidating shared middleware (CORS, error normalization) would reduce duplication prior to scaling new feeds.【F:api-unified/blaze-analytics-api.js†L1-L80】
- The new `social-media-intelligence` worker introduces structured fan/official/media streams for the Cardinals, Longhorns (football/baseball), Titans, Orioles, and Grizzlies, delivering normalized author metadata, engagement metrics, and rate-limit telemetry to downstream dashboards.【F:api-unified/social-media-intelligence.js†L1-L320】
- Mock datasets embedded in the worker (`SOCIAL_INTELLIGENCE_USE_MOCK`) enable deterministic testing within Netlify Functions and Cloudflare Workers, removing the need for live X credentials in CI pipelines.【F:api-unified/social-media-intelligence.js†L320-L471】

### Security & Privacy Observations
- Headers enforce `X-Frame-Options=DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, aligning with enterprise web hygiene, but inline analytics scripts dilute threat reduction.【F:netlify.toml†L15-L24】
- Credentials for third-party APIs remain scattered across shell scripts (`deploy-production.sh`, `setup-secrets-sync.sh`) and documentation; centralizing secret management (e.g., Netlify build environment or 1Password Connect) is recommended before onboarding partner teams.【F:setup-secrets-sync.sh†L1-L80】

## Quick-Win Recommendations (1–2 Weeks)
1. **Implement asset bundling & lazy loading:** move CDN libraries into a Vite build, split critical CSS, and defer non-essential animations to cut first paint times by 30%+.
2. **Harden analytics deployment:** inject GA4 IDs and consent states through Netlify environment variables; add server-side tracking for lead-gen conversions.
3. **Accessibility sweeps:** add semantic landmarks, high-contrast button variants, and `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries for Three.js scenes.
4. **Update robots & sitemap:** ensure canonical domain consistency, publish XML sitemap from the active Netlify deployment, and submit updates to Search Console.

## Strategic Initiatives (4–8 Weeks)
- **Experience Platform Refactor:** componentize the landing experience (Next.js or Astro) to enable localization, personalization, and rapid feature toggles without editing monolithic HTML.
- **Unified Data Layer:** establish a shared data access layer for SportsDataIO, Perfect Game, and Social Media Intelligence to guarantee consistent authentication, caching, and alerting.
- **Security Modernization:** remove inline scripts/styles, tighten CSP, and adopt a secrets-as-code workflow (Git-crypt/SOPS) aligned with enterprise compliance audits.
- **Insight Delivery:** pair the social intelligence feed with automated executive briefings (e.g., weekly Cardinals competitive pulse) using existing narrative generators.

## Next Steps & Ownership
- Prioritize a cross-functional workshop (product, engineering, content) to align on the refactor roadmap and analytics OKRs.
- Assign a platform engineer to own asset bundling and CSP remediation; target completion prior to additional NIL or AR module launches.
- Configure monitoring on the new social intelligence worker (rate limits, query health) and integrate results into the Blaze executive console prototypes.
