## üîß Implementation Guide

### 1. Feature Registry Setup

```bash
# Validate all feature definitions
python tools/features/validate_features.py --schema features/schema.json --features features/*.yaml

# Generate property-based tests
python tools/features/property_test_generator.py --features features/ --output tests/features/

# Run comprehensive validation
python tests/features/deep_south_property_tests.py
```

### 2. Feature Engine Usage

```python
from features_impl import DeepSouthFeatureEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = DeepSouthFeatureEngine()

# Compute baseball features
prospect_scores = engine.prospect_development_index_youth_to_mlb(perfect_game_data)
recruiting_strength = engine.sec_baseball_recruiting_strength_score(recruiting_data)

# Compute football features
authority_scores = engine.dave_campbells_authority_score(texas_hs_data)
pipeline_impact = engine.friday_night_lights_impact_index(player_data)

# Get performance report
report = engine.get_feature_performance_report()
```

### 3. Drift Detection

```bash
# Run drift detection
python tools/features/deep_south_drift_detection.py \
  --baseline data/baseline.csv \
  --candidate data/current.csv \
  --feature prospect_development_index_youth_to_mlb \
  --sport baseball \
  --output reports/drift_report.json
```

### 4. Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy feature to staging
python tools/features/deep_south_production_deployment.py deploy \
  --feature dave_campbells_authority_score \
  --version v1.0.0 \
  --sport football \
  --environment staging

# Approve deployment
python tools/features/deep_south_production_deployment.py approve \
  --deployment-id abc123 \
