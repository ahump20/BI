# üî• MANUAL FIX REQUIRED - blazesportsintel.com

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Website deployed** to Cloudflare Pages (https://c7f16bd6.blazesportsintel.pages.dev)
- ‚ùå **blazesportsintel.com** still showing Worker API endpoints

## Manual Steps in Cloudflare Dashboard (Now Open in Chrome)

### Step 1: Find and Remove the Worker
1. In the dashboard that just opened, click on **Workers** tab (not Pages)
2. Look for a Worker with one of these names:
   - `blaze-vision-ai`
   - `blazesportsintel`
   - `blaze-intelligence`
   - Any Worker with "vision" or "blaze" in the name

3. Click on the Worker that has the vision endpoints
4. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Triggers** or **Routes**
5. You'll see routes like:
   - `blazesportsintel.com/*`
   - `*.blazesportsintel.com/*`
   - `www.blazesportsintel.com/*`

6. **DELETE ALL ROUTES** for blazesportsintel.com
7. Optionally: Delete the entire Worker if it's not needed

### Step 2: Verify Pages Configuration
1. Go back to **Workers & Pages** ‚Üí **Pages** tab
2. Click on `blazesportsintel` project
3. Click on **Custom domains** tab
4. Verify `blazesportsintel.com` is listed
5. If not there, click **Set up a custom domain** and add it

### Step 3: Clear DNS Cache (Optional)
If the site doesn't immediately work:
```bash
# macOS
dscacheutil -flushcache

# Or in Chrome
# Go to: chrome://net-internals/#dns
# Click "Clear host cache"
```

### Step 4: Verify Success
1. Wait 1-2 minutes
2. Visit https://blazesportsintel.com
3. You should see:
   - üî• Blaze Sports Intel championship platform
   - Deep South Sports Authority branding
   - Live sports data for Cardinals, Titans, Grizzlies, Longhorns
   - 3D particle effects and animations
   - Interactive dashboards

## What You're Fixing
The Worker with vision endpoints is intercepting all traffic to blazesportsintel.com. By removing its routes, traffic will flow to your Pages deployment instead.

## Alternative: Complete Worker Deletion
If you don't need the vision AI Worker at all:
1. In the Workers list, click the Worker
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion
4. This permanently removes the Worker and all its routes

## Verification Command
After completing the manual steps, run:
```bash
curl -I https://blazesportsintel.com | head -5
```

You should see `HTTP/2 200` instead of the API error message.
