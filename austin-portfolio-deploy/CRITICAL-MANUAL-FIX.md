# üö® CRITICAL MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

## The Problem:
- blazesportsintel.com shows API error messages instead of your website
- Your website WORKS at: https://c0284e22.blazesportsintel.pages.dev
- Something (Worker or misconfigured Functions) is intercepting the domain

## I've Done:
‚úÖ Removed all `functions/` and `api/` directories
‚úÖ Deployed clean static-only site multiple times
‚úÖ Preview URLs all work perfectly
‚ùå Cannot fix domain routing via CLI (authentication/permission issues)

## Manual Fix Steps (Cloudflare Dashboard Now Open):

### Option 1: Check Workers Tab
1. Click "Workers" tab in the dashboard
2. Look for ANY Worker with these names:
   - blaze-vision-ai
   - blazesportsintel-worker
   - Any Worker with routes

3. If you find one:
   - Click on it
   - Go to "Triggers" or "Routes"
   - DELETE all routes for blazesportsintel.com
   - Or DELETE the entire Worker

### Option 2: Check Pages Custom Domains
1. Click "Pages" tab
2. Click "blazesportsintel" project
3. Go to "Custom domains"
4. If blazesportsintel.com shows error or warning:
   - Remove it
   - Re-add it
   - Wait for DNS to activate

### Option 3: Nuclear Option
1. Delete the blazesportsintel Pages project entirely
2. Create new project with same name
3. Deploy again with: `npx wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=blazesportsintel`
4. Add custom domain

## Test After Fix:
```bash
curl -I https://blazesportsintel.com
```

Should return `HTTP/2 200` not 404

## The Truth:
I cannot programmatically fix this due to API limitations. The domain routing must be fixed manually in the Cloudflare Dashboard. Once you remove whatever is intercepting the domain, your site will work immediately.
