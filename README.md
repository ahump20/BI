## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Cloudflare account (for deployment)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ahump20/blaze-intelligence.git
cd blaze-intelligence

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run serve

# Start MCP server for analytics
npm run mcp-server
```

### Production Deployment

# Deploy to Cloudflare
wrangler pages deploy

# Or use deployment script
./03_AUTOMATION/shell/deploy-production.sh
```

## 🏈 Texas High School Football API

Blaze Intelligence now aggregates Texas high school football program data by stitching together MaxPreps game results, 247Sports recruiting intel, and Rivals rankings. The service normalizes records, schedules, player profiles, and consensus recruiting rankings into a single payload that can be consumed by dashboards, analytics notebooks, or downstream automations.

**Endpoint**

```http
GET /api/texas-hs-football/program
```

**Query Parameters**

- `team` *(optional)* – Friendly team name used for metadata when source pages do not expose it.
- `season` *(optional)* – Target season, passed through to upstream scrapers when available.
- `maxprepsTeamPath` *(recommended)* – Path or URL fragment to the MaxPreps program page (e.g. `tx/duncanville/duncanville-panthers/football`).
- `maxprepsTeamId` *(alternative)* – MaxPreps numeric team identifier if the path is not known.
- `s247TeamPath` *(optional)* – 247Sports team path or slug for recruiting coverage.
- `rivalsTeamPath` *(optional)* – Rivals team path or slug for recruiting coverage.
- `includeSchedule` *(default: true)* – Set to `false` to skip schedule scraping for faster responses.
- `includePlayerStats` *(default: true)* – Set to `false` to bypass roster parsing.
- `includeRecruiting` *(default: true)* – Set to `false` to suppress 247Sports and Rivals fetches.
- `includeRaw` *(default: false)* – When `true`, returns the structured JSON blobs captured from each source.
- `forceRefresh` *(default: false)* – Bypass the in-memory cache and fetch fresh data.

**Example**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/texas-hs-football/program?team=Duncanville+Panthers&season=2024&maxprepsTeamPath=tx/duncanville/duncanville-panthers/football&s247TeamPath=/college/texas/Season/2024-Football/Commits/&rivalsTeamPath=/teams/football/texas/commitments"
```

The API responds with a structured object that includes program metadata, records, advanced team stats, normalized schedule results, player summaries, combined recruiting boards, and quick-hit insights such as scoring margins or consensus rankings. All responses are cached for 15 minutes by default to protect upstream sources.

## 🤖 Developer Automation: Blaze Autopilot

Accelerate cross-platform launches with the `automation/blaze-autopilot.ts` orchestrator. The script opportunistically fires any
connector that has credentials in the environment, then prints a summary of what succeeded.

```bash
pnpm add -D tsx                # one-time setup
pnpm tsx automation/blaze-autopilot.ts "My Campaign Name"
```

The orchestrator currently supports GitHub gists, Netlify build hooks, Cloudflare cache purges, Cloudinary uploads, Dropbox,
Box, Notion, HubSpot, Linear, Render, Stripe checkout sessions, and Zapier webhooks. Set the relevant tokens from the ENV map at
the bottom of the script and connectors without credentials are skipped automatically.
