        this.neurons = 25;
        this.synapses = 18;
        this.processing = 94.2;
        this.responseTime = 47;
    }
    
    start() {
        this.updateLoop();
        this.connectToConsciousnessStream();
    }
}

// Sports Data Streamer  
class SportsDataStreamer {
    updateSportsData() {
        // Cardinals, Titans, Longhorns, Grizzlies metrics
