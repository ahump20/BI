  <h1>Methods &amp; Definitions</h1>
  <p>Blaze Intelligence blends computer vision, predictive modeling, and real-time telemetry to produce the metrics you see across the platform. This quick reference outlines the core methods and how we define championship readiness.</p>
  <h2>Modeling Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pattern Recognition Engine</strong> – ensembles of gradient boosted trees and recurrent neural networks tuned on MLB, NFL, NCAA, and NBA datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>Championship Probability</strong> – Monte Carlo simulations across 50K+ seasons per refresh incorporating injury risk, schedule leverage, and opponent efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Decision Velocity</strong> – weighted average of scouting cycle time, coaching adjustments, and operations response benchmarks.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Key Definitions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance Accuracy</strong>: Rolling 30-day forecast accuracy vs. observed outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Readiness</strong>: Composite of health, depth, and execution metrics normalized to 0–100.</li>
    <li><strong>Clutch Factor</strong>: Late-game win probability added per athlete adjusted for opponent strength.</li>
    <li><strong>Velocity Score</strong>: Time-to-insight for front office and coaching staff, expressed on a 1–10 scale.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Sources</h2>
  <p>Live feeds from partner APIs, internal scouting reports, biometric wearables (Cardinals/Titans/Longhorns/Grizzlies), and Blaze engineered tracking sensors.</p>
