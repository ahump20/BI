---

## 🧠 FLOW STATE ANALYTICS ENGINE

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. **Flow Prediction Model**
- **Pre-Game Flow Probability Score**: Analyze athlete's recent performance patterns, stress indicators, and environmental conditions to predict likelihood of entering flow
- **Real-Time Flow Detection**: Using performance metrics (reaction time, movement efficiency, decision velocity) to identify when athletes enter "the zone"
- **Flow Sustainability Index**: Predict how long an athlete can maintain peak state based on physiological markers

#### 2. **Neurobiological Performance Markers**
Integrate these measurable indicators into existing dashboards:

| Metric | Current Blaze Capability | Flow Enhancement |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Decision Velocity | ✓ Tracked | + Transient hypofrontality detection |
| Pattern Recognition | ✓ 94.6% accuracy | + Dopamine-driven pattern enhancement tracking |
| Reaction Time | ✓ <100ms response | + Flow state multiplier (230% faster learning) |
| Performance Consistency | ✓ Standard deviation | + Automaticity index |
| Team Synchronization | ✓ Chemistry score | + Group flow indicators |

#### 3. **Challenge-Skill Optimizer**
- **Dynamic Difficulty Algorithm**: Real-time recommendations for coaches to adjust strategy/personnel to maintain optimal 4% challenge threshold
- **Skill Progression Tracking**: Identify when athletes need new challenges to prevent boredom
- **Anxiety Detection**: Alert when challenge exceeds skill by >10%, risking performance anxiety

    if (batterFlowState > 0.8) {
      return "Disrupt rhythm: Change speeds dramatically";
