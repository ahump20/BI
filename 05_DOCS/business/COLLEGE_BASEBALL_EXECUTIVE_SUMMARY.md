# College Baseball Product - Executive Summary & Implementation Roadmap

**Blaze Intelligence - Strategic Initiative**  
**Product Category:** Mobile-First Sports Intelligence Platform  
**Target Market:** NCAA Division I Baseball (Beachhead)  
**Document Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

## TL;DR - The Opportunity

**Market Gap:** College baseball fans (150K-350K monthly active users) are underserved by ESPN (limited mobile experience) and D1Baseball (paywall friction). There's a clear opportunity for a mobile-first product delivering full box scores, live updates, and personalized notifications.

**The Solution:** Build on existing Blaze Intelligence infrastructure (React Native app, Cloudflare Workers, NCAA data patterns) to launch an iOS app in 3-4 months with 6-8 FTE team and $1.0M-1.3M Year 1 budget.

**Why It Works:**
- **40-50% development time savings** leveraging existing infrastructure
- **Validated business model:** Subscriptions ($7.99/month Diamond Pro) + ads + affiliates
- **Repeatable playbook:** Expand to softball, lacrosse, volleyball with 80% code reuse
- **Strategic positioning:** "The Dave Campbell's Texas Football of Deep South sports"

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Year 1: 50K-100K downloads, $15K-40K revenue (expected loss while building)
- Year 2: 150K-250K users, $375K-1M revenue, approaching profitability
- Year 3: 150K-300K users, $1.2M-3M revenue, sustainable business

## Strategic Rationale

### Why College Baseball? Why Now?

**1. Proven Fan Engagement**
- College World Series: 1.5M+ TV viewers per game
- r/collegebaseball: 75K+ engaged members
- Social media spikes during postseason demonstrate acquisition channels

**2. Clear Competitive Gaps**
- ESPN mobile: Score + inning only, poor UX, no sortable stats
- D1Baseball: Web-first, aggressive paywall, slow updates
- NCAA.org: Antiquated interface, desktop-only

**3. Mobile-First Consumer Behavior**
- 70%+ of sports content consumed on mobile
- Push notifications drive daily engagement
- Thumb-friendly UX is table stakes for Gen Z and Millennials

**4. Infrastructure Leverage**
- Blaze Intelligence already has React Native mobile app
- Cloudflare Workers edge API ready to scale
- NCAA football data patterns extend seamlessly to baseball
- 6-9 month development vs. 12-18 months from scratch

**5. Multi-Sport Platform Vision**
- College baseball validates playbook
- Softball launch in Month 18 (80% code reuse)
- Lacrosse, volleyball, hockey follow
- Smooth seasonality, increase TAM to 1M+ users

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Data Reliability (Highest Priority)

**Challenge:** Web scraping is fragile; NCAA and D1Baseball can break scrapers 2-5x per season.

**Solution:**
- Multi-source strategy: NCAA Stats + D1Baseball + team athletic sites
- Automated health checks every 5 minutes with alerting
- Dedicate 20% of data engineer time to scraper maintenance
- Fast-track paid API integration after 20K+ MAU validation (Month 7-9)
- Data reconciliation layer merges sources intelligently

**Investment:** $60K-90K Year 1 for paid API (Sportradar), $20K for legal counsel

### 2. Mobile UX Excellence

**Challenge:** Fans compare every app to best-in-class (ESPN, The Athletic, ESPN Fantasy).

**Solution:**
- Hire experienced mobile designer (0.7 FTE, $90K-130K)
- Prioritize thumb-friendly navigation and sub-200ms interactions
- Aggressive caching for offline-first experience
- Beta test with 500-1,000 users before public launch
- Iterate weekly based on usage analytics

**Investment:** $90K-130K for designer, $10K-20K for beta testing incentives

### 3. Community-Driven Growth

**Challenge:** Paid user acquisition in college baseball is expensive ($15-30 per active user).

**Solution:**
- Target 70% organic acquisition through community seeding
- Partner with college baseball podcasters and YouTubers ($10K-20K)
- Reddit and Twitter engagement with authentic participation
- Viral product features (clip sharing, prediction contests)
- Product-led growth: Free tier is genuinely valuable

**Investment:** $40K-85K Year 1 marketing (creator partnerships + paid acquisition)

### 4. Rapid Iteration Post-Launch

**Challenge:** First version will have gaps; user feedback must drive priorities.

**Solution:**
- Deploy analytics from day one (Firebase, Mixpanel)
- Weekly usage review meetings with product + engineering
- 1-2 week release cadence for bug fixes and small features
- Public roadmap and feature voting (Canny, GitHub Discussions)
- Dedicated support channel (email, Reddit, Twitter DMs)

**Investment:** $5K-10K for analytics and support tools

## Recommended Budget Scenario

### Moderate Scenario: $1.0M - $1.3M Year 1

**Why This Budget:**
- Right-sized team (6-8 FTE) balances speed and capability
- Paid data API starting Month 7 (after validation) de-risks data quality
- Balanced marketing mix (organic + paid) supports 50K-100K downloads
- Market-rate salaries attract quality talent
- **Risk-adjusted for realistic execution**

**Budget Breakdown:**

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Personnel** | $805K | Product Lead, Mobile Eng, Backend Eng, Data Eng, Designer, Growth, Editorial |
| **Data API** | $60K-90K | Sportradar starting Month 7, $10K-15K/month |
| **Infrastructure** | $24K-60K | Cloudflare, storage, monitoring tools |
| **Marketing** | $40K-85K | Creator partnerships, paid acquisition, app store assets |
| **Legal & Admin** | $23K-47K | Legal counsel, accounting, insurance |
| **Contingency (10%)** | $96K-135K | Buffer for unexpected costs |
| **Total** | **$1,048K-1,322K** | **Recommended** |

**Alternative Scenarios:**

**Lean ($600K-800K):**
- Smaller team (5 FTE), delay paid API, minimal marketing
- **Risk:** Slower development, data quality issues, limited scale
- **When to use:** Pre-seed funding, bootstrap mode

**Aggressive ($1.5M-2.5M):**
- Larger team (8-10 FTE), paid API from Month 4, significant marketing
- **Benefit:** Faster time-to-market, better product quality, larger scale
- **When to use:** Strong seed funding, competitive pressure
