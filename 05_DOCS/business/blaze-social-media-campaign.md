#### **Post 3: Problem/Solution Story**

üí° Why I Built Blaze Intelligence: A Personal Mission

Growing up as a multi-sport athlete (football, baseball, track), I watched too many talented players get derailed by preventable injuries and poor decision-making.

THE PROBLEM:
‚Ä¢ 60% of draft picks fail to meet expectations
‚Ä¢ Teams lose $5M annually to preventable injuries  
‚Ä¢ Decisions made on incomplete, reactive data
‚Ä¢ Gut instincts over predictive intelligence

THE SOLUTION:
Blaze Intelligence combines AI, computer vision, and real-time analytics to:
‚úÖ Predict injury risk with 89% accuracy
‚úÖ Assess character traits through micro-expressions
‚úÖ Optimize performance with personalized training
‚úÖ Provide instant competitive advantages

From the football fields of Texas to the front offices of professional sports - this platform represents everything I've learned about turning cognitive performance into quarterly performance.
