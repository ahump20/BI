# College Baseball Mobile-First Product - Implementation Plan

**Blaze Intelligence - The Dave Campbell's of Deep South Sports**  
**Product Category:** Mobile-First Sports Intelligence Platform  
**Target Market:** College Baseball (D1) Beachhead  
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## Executive Summary

College baseball represents a validated, high-value beachhead market with passionate TV viewership, institutional spending, and a mobile-first fanbase underserved by incumbent apps like ESPN. This implementation plan converts market opportunity into a concrete technical roadmap, team structure, timeline, and measurable KPIs for launching a mobile-first college baseball product within the existing Blaze Intelligence infrastructure.

**Core Value Proposition:** Deliver complete data and UX that fans expect (full box scores, sortable stats, schedules, previews/recaps) where ESPN currently provides only score + inning.

**Strategic Advantage:** Leverage existing Blaze Intelligence infrastructure (React Native mobile app, Cloudflare Workers backend, NCAA data integration patterns) to accelerate time-to-market and reduce development costs by 40-50%.

```

### Data Sourcing Strategy

**Tier 1 (MVP): Free/Scraped Sources**
1. **NCAA Official Stats** (stats.ncaa.org)
   - JSON endpoints for box scores
   - Play-by-play data (limited)
   - Team and player pages
   - Limitations: Slow updates (5-10 min delay), occasional downtime

2. **D1Baseball.com** (scraping)
   - Comprehensive game coverage
   - Rankings and analysis
   - Limitations: Rate limits, anti-scraping measures, legal considerations

3. **Team Athletic Sites** (JSON feeds where available)
   - Direct from athletic departments
   - Real-time for some schools
   - Limitations: Inconsistent formats, not all teams available

**Tier 2 (Post-MVP): Paid Data API**
- **Sportradar College Sports API:** $10K-30K/month for full D1 coverage
- **Genius Sports:** Similar pricing, better international coverage
- **Synergy Sports:** Coach-focused but has consumer API tier
- **Recommendation:** Sportradar for brand recognition and reliability

**Implementation:**
- Start with free sources for MVP validation
- Contract paid API after demonstrating 20K+ MAU
- Use paid API as authoritative source, scrapers as fallback
- Implement data reconciliation layer to merge sources intelligently

### Caching & Performance Strategy

**Aggressive Edge Caching (Cloudflare KV + D1):**
```javascript
// Live game caching
const CACHE_TTL = {
  LIVE_GAME_LIST: 30,      // 30 seconds for active games
  LIVE_BOX_SCORE: 15,      // 15 seconds for in-progress box scores
  FINAL_GAME: 3600,        // 1 hour for completed games
  STANDINGS: 300,          // 5 minutes for standings
  SCHEDULE: 86400,         // 24 hours for schedules
  PLAYER_PROFILE: 3600,    // 1 hour for player data
  HISTORICAL: 604800       // 7 days for historical data
};
```

**Merge & Reconcile Layer:**
- Normalize player/team identifiers across sources
- Deduplicate game entries
- Conflict resolution rules (paid API > official NCAA > scraped)
- Missing data interpolation strategies

**Observability & Alerting:**
- Scraper health checks every 5 minutes
- Data staleness detection (alert if >10 min delay)
- API rate limit monitoring with auto-throttling
- Error rate tracking with Sentry integration
- Weekly data quality reports

### Operations & Maintenance

**Daily Operations:**
- Scraper health monitoring (automated checks)
- Data quality spot checks (sample 5-10 games manually)
- User-reported issues triage
- Push notification queue management

**Weekly Operations:**
- Data source uptime review
- API usage and cost tracking
- User feedback aggregation and prioritization
- Content moderation for community features

**Seasonal Operations:**
- Pre-season: Data source testing, feature updates
- Peak season: Increased monitoring, rapid bug fixes
- Post-season: Infrastructure optimization, feature development
- Off-season: Major updates, new sport expansion prep

**Legal & IP Considerations:**
- Review scraping approach with legal counsel
- Implement robots.txt compliance
- User-Agent identification
- Rate limiting respect
- Terms of service for paid APIs
- DMCA compliance for user-generated content

- Impact: High (no data = no product value)
- Mitigation:
  - Multi-source data strategy (don't rely on single scraper)
  - Automated health checks every 5 minutes with alerts
  - Dedicate 20% of data engineer time to scraper maintenance
  - Fast-track paid API integration after validation (Month 7)
  - Maintain community-sourced backup data reporting

**Risk: NCAA Legal/IP Issues with Scraping**
- Probability: Low-Medium (NCAA has not aggressively pursued)
- Impact: High (could shut down free data sources)
- Mitigation:
  - Legal counsel review of scraping approach upfront
  - Respect robots.txt and rate limits
  - Clearly identify User-Agent
  - Transition to paid, licensed data ASAP
  - Build relationships with NCAA and conferences

**Risk: Performance & Scalability Issues**
- Probability: Medium (common with rapid growth)
- Impact: Medium (poor UX, churn)
- Mitigation:
  - Aggressive edge caching from day one
  - Load testing before season launch (simulate 100K users)
  - Auto-scaling Cloudflare Workers
  - CDN for static assets
  - Performance monitoring and alerting (Sentry, Cloudflare Analytics)

**Risk: Mobile Platform Rejections (App Store, Play Store)**
- Probability: Low (with proper compliance)
- Impact: High (delays launch)

- Impact: High (can't reach revenue targets)
- Mitigation:
  - Start community seeding early (Month 4-5)
  - Allocate 20-30% budget to growth activities
  - Partner with established creators and media
  - Viral product features (clip sharing, predictions)
  - Paid acquisition budget as safety net

**Risk: Low Conversion to Paid Subscriptions**
- Probability: Medium (fans distrust paywalls)
- Impact: High (longer path to profitability)
- Mitigation:
  - Keep free tier genuinely valuable
  - Transparent pricing and value proposition
  - 14-day trial with no credit card required
  - Annual discount to lock in subscribers

- Mitigation:
  - Focus on organic channels first (70% target)
  - Test small paid campaigns before scaling
  - Strict CAC targets (<$10 CPI, <$30 active user)
  - Pivot to creator partnerships if ads underperform

**Risk: Paid Data API Costs Exceed Budget**
- Probability: Medium (enterprise pricing can escalate)
- Impact: Medium (squeezes margins)
- Mitigation:
  - Negotiate volume discounts after validation
  - Consider multiple smaller providers vs. one enterprise
  - Maintain scraping as cost fallback
  - Pass some costs to Diamond Pro subscribers

**Risk: Slow Fundraising or Investor Skepticism**
- Probability: Medium (niche market concern)
- Impact: High (constrains budget)
- Mitigation:
  - Bootstrap-friendly lean budget option ($600K-800K)
  - Prove unit economics early (Month 9-12)
  - Frame as multi-sport platform, not just baseball
  - Target sports tech investors and former athletes/coaches
