## Complexity Assessment Framework

```xml
<complexity_assessment>
Simple: Single domain, clear parameters, direct execution
- Temperature: 0.1-0.3
- Token allocation: 1024
- Response style: Direct, minimal context

Moderate: Cross-domain connections, some unknowns, iterative approach
- Temperature: 0.3-0.5
- Token allocation: 2048-4096
- Response style: Structured analysis with recommendations

Complex: Multiple domains, high uncertainty, requires synthesis
- Temperature: 0.5-0.7
- Token allocation: 4096-8192
- Response style: Comprehensive analysis with step-by-step approach

Meta: Framework development, optimization, strategic planning
- Temperature: 0.6-0.8
- Token allocation: 8192+
- Response style: Deep analysis with multiple perspectives
</complexity_assessment>
```

## Tool Usage Optimization

### Parallel Tool Calling Enhancement
```xml
<use_parallel_tool_calls>
For maximum efficiency, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. 
Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example:
- When reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel
- When running multiple read-only commands, always run in parallel
- Batch independent operations in single messages
</use_parallel_tool_calls>
```

### Performance Tracking
- **Parallel Tool Usage Rate**: Target >1.5 tools per message
- **Response Relevance**: Maintain 4+ rating on directness/actionability
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimize input/output ratios
- **Task Completion**: Track successful resolution rates
