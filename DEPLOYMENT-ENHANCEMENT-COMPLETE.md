# 🚀 Deployment Enhancement - Complete

## 🎯 Hawk-Eye MCP Server Purpose
The Hawk-Eye Model Context Protocol (MCP) server streams real-time baseball tracking data (player positioning, pitch metrics, and ball trajectories) and packages it into a unified analytics feed. This server powers Blaze Intelligence features that require precision field data and integrates seamlessly with downstream automation pipelines.

## 🔐 Required Environment Variables
Configure the following environment variables for HS and BASEBALL API access before deployment:

```bash
# High School sports API
HS_API_KEY="<your-hs-api-key>"
HS_API_URL="https://api.your-hs-provider.com"

# Baseball analytics API
BASEBALL_API_KEY="<your-baseball-api-key>"
BASEBALL_API_URL="https://api.your-baseball-provider.com"
```

## 🌐 Netlify Domain
The production site is served at:

- **https://blaze-intelligence.netlify.app**

Ensure this domain is linked in Netlify and authorized in any CORS configuration.

## 📦 Deployment & Verification
Deploy and validate updates using the Netlify CLI:

```bash
# Install the CLI if needed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy current build to production
netlify deploy --prod

# Verify the live site
netlify status
curl -I https://blaze-intelligence.netlify.app
```
